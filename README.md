Express Uploading Image Demo
============================

```
npm install
node index.js
```

Then open your browser to open <http://localhost:3000/>, and you can upload an image now (note only image files can be selected).

The uploaded image will be inside the `uploaded-images` directory of server side, with a timestamp added in the file name.
